# Cryptopals Set 1 – Challenge 4: Detect Single-Character XOR
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Challenge Goal

This challenge upped the ante by providing a file containing 60 lines of hex strings. Only **one line in the entire file** was encrypted with a single-byte XOR; the rest were random noise.

### What I Learned

*   **Scalability:** I learned how to "pipeline" the solution from Challenge 3, running my scoring engine across multiple potential candidates.
    
*   **Signal vs. Noise:** When dealing with large datasets, the "highest score" is your only compass. Most lines produced gibberish with very low scores, making the one true sentence stand out.
    
*   **File I/O:** Practical experience in reading raw data from external files and processing it line-by-line efficiently.
